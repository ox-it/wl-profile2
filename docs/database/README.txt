What is in here:
--------------

database/		- contains scripts for creating the database tables if you do not have auto.ddl on
				- also contains conversion scripts for performing conversion between releases.

Creation scripts exist for Profile2 version 1.1 for all supported databases and for the conversion from
1.0.1 to 1.1 for Oracle and MySQL.

For releases beyond 1.1 I will endeavour to create upgrade scripts for the other databases.

For any errors or omissions, please open a Jira ticket at http://jira.sakaiproject.org/jira/browse/PRFL
