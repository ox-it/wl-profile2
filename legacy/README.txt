This is the legacy API and IMPL that has been brought across from the original Profile to allow integrations
with other tools to continue (ie Roster).

This code is designed to be deployed just like the original Profile was, without the actual tool though
and has been updated to emplky Profile2 methods. 


Profile2 has NO DEPENDENCY on this package, but there IS a dependency on Profile2 code from this package.


TODO:
There will be a set of POM's and package structure inside this folder that will deploy to a legacy structure
in Sakai so the API's and models are available.
