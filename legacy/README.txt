This is the legacy API and IMPL that has been brought across from the original Profile to allow integrations
with other tools to continue (ie Roster).

This code is designed to be deployed just like the original Profile was, without the actual tool though
and has been updated to use Profile2 methods. 

Profile2 has NO DEPENDENCY on this package, but there IS a dependency on Profile2 code from this package.
