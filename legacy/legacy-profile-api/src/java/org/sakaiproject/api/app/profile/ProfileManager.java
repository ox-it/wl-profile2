/**
 * This is the legacy ProfileManager API, adapted to work in Profile2.
 * <p>DO NOT USE THIS FOR NEW TOOLS. This is for legacy tool support only, 
 * ie tools that already bind to the original Profile API and need to also work in Profile2.</p>
 * <p>
 * Notes:<br />
 * ------<br />
 * Official photo used to be loaded into the JPEG_PHOTO field in SakaiPerson, and thus available as a byte[].<br />
 * You could only ever set a URL to your personal profile picture. Thus for Roster, the Profile pictures are a URL only.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * How this is adapted for Profile2.<br />
 * --------------------------------<br />
 * In profile2, you can have only one active profile image at a time. Uploaded images are stored in ContentHosting and URLs are stored as a record
 * in PROFILE_IMAGES_EXTERNAL_T. If an institution needs to control this, the best and easiest way is to
 * add a record to PROFILE_IMAGES_EXTERNAL_T and lock down the ability for user's change the image via the Profile2 sakai.properties
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * So, Roster will be looking at the byte[] field for an official photo and the url field for a profile image.<br />
 * Profile2 has a ResourceWrapper class which wraps a binary resource. The byte[] is there and the URL is created via EntityBroker.<br />
 * These values are returned in the methods below. So Roster always gets the same value for Official and profile pictures.
 * </p>
